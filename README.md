### 🏛️ Projects

#### **Graph**

This folder is for grid-based animations and patterns.

* **Goal:** Show how grids and dots change over time.
* **Math:** Uses rules based on nearby dots to decide what happens next.
* **Files:** Includes the code, images, and settings needed for the animation.

#### **Coming Soon**

New folders will be added for other math topics like shapes and numbers.

### 🧬 How it's Made

All projects follow these simple rules:

* **Stay Organized:** Every project gets its own folder so nothing gets messy.
* **Fast Math:** Uses math tools like NumPy to keep things running well.
* **Clear Text:** Uses LaTeX to make sure math symbols look right.
